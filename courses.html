                <p>Once you have applied for your dream course, you will be invited to an interview. You will then be offered a place. You will not be able to enrol until after you have received your GCSE results which come out in August. Buckinghamshire College will then be open for enrolment. You will be sent a letter inviting you in to enrol for your course. We will keep in touch with you throughout the process updating you on the next steps. If you need to check anything then please contact our admissions team who will be able to help you.</p>

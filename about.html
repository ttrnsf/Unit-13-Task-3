        <h2>Why Choose Buckinghamshire College Group?</h2>
        <div class="">
            <p>No matter what your background is, our mission is to transform lives through learning and help you achieve your full potential. We operate from three main campuses in Aylesbury, Wycombe and Amersham, each of which has industry standard facilities in which you will learn and practice your skills, supported by technology that helps bring learning to life.</p>
            <p>What makes us special? #BUCKSCOLLEGEFACTOR is our way of highlighting the exceptional links we have to key employers and industries. We have partnerships with Creative Media Skills (based at Pinewood Studios) for our creative students and a number of our Health and Social Care students have become Nurse Cadets with the NHS, supporting our key workers at this difficult time. Full-time students will be encouraged to grow and flourish in an environment that is structured in a way you would not find at school. While part-time and 19+ students will find that we can open the door to higher education with a more affordable and convenient alternative to University. We are also Buckinghamshire's biggest provider of Apprenticeships with work based learning opportunities in Business, Construction, Engineering, Healthcare and more.</p>
